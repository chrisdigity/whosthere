# Privacy Policy for "Who's There?" Discord Application

**Effective Date:** Monday, 09 July 2024 00:00:00 GMT

Welcome to "Who's There?", the Discord Application that announces voice channel events. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring the security of your personal information. This Privacy Policy explains how we collect, use, and share information when you use our Application on Discord.

## Information We Collect

To provide our services, we collect usernames, display names, and user identification (ID) numbers associated with the events, as well as details about the voice activity event, including the channel ID and server ID in which the events occur.

## How We Use Your Information

The information we collect is used solely to generate audio resources using a third-party text-to-speech (TTS) service, and to improve the quality and performance of our services by caching these generated resources.

## Data Security and Sharing

We take data security seriously and employ cryptographic hasing and secure (encrypted) protocols to protect data where possible. Usernames and display names are cryptographically hashed using SHA256 before caching associated resources and secure protocols are used to share data with the third-party TTS service. However, for the purpose of TTS generation, identifiers (usernames, display names, and associated event details) are shared with the third-party service in their original form. We do not share your information with other third parties except when required by law; we may disclose information to comply with legal obligations or to respond to lawful requests.

## Data Retention and Removal

We retain the information collected for as long as necessary to fulfill the purposes outlined in this Privacy Policy, unless a longer retention period is required or permitted by law. Additionally, to manage our data storage efficiently, information that has not been used or accessed for an extended period may be removed from our systems.

## Your Rights and Choices

Depending on your jurisdiction, you may have the following rights regarding your personal information:

- **Access:** You may request access to the personal information we hold about you.
- **Correction:** You may request that we correct any inaccuracies in your personal information.
- **Deletion:** You may request that we delete your personal information, subject to certain conditions.

To exercise these rights, please contact us privately in the ["Who's There" Discord Server](https://discord.gg/VuHfxKa2T9).

## Changes to this Privacy Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. When we do, we will revise the "Effective Date" at the top of this policy. Changes will be communicated through the "announcements" channel of the ["Who's There" Discord Server](https://discord.gg/VuHfxKa2T9), and your continued use of the service after such notice will constitute acceptance of the changes. We encourage you to review this Privacy Policy periodically to stay informed about how we are protecting your information.
