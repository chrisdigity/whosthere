Introducing "Who's There?", the Discord Application that announces voice channel events. Maybe you're in streamer mode, maybe your overlay isn't working, or maybe you're too focused to "tab out". "Who's There?" provides a quick mention for users that move around your Discord voice channels.

*Before use, please read the [Spam Warning](#spam-warning) to help make the right choice for your discord.*

## Installation

By inviting "Who's There?" to your Discord server, you agree to the [Terms of Service](terms.md) and [Privacy Policy](privacy.md), and accept responsibility for informing the members of your Discord server about these policies.

To get "who's There?" in your Discord server, you can [Invite "Who's There?"](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1254740663862300732)

### Permissions

* "Connect" is required for "Who's There?" to connect to voice channels
* "Speak" is required for "Who's There?" to speak in voice channels
* "Move Members" (OPTIONAL) is only required for "Who's There?" to enter a voice channel that has reached it's capacity. "Who's There?" DOES NOT move members around. The next best permission for this functionality is "Administrator", and I simply refuse...

## Usage

Simply enter a voice channel with existing members. "Who's There?" will not announce "join" events to a single person, nor announce "leave" events to nobody. That's just silly.

### Private channels

By default, "Who's There?" has no access to private channels. This is by design. Although it is one solution, it is NOT recommended to give the bot the "Administrator" permission. The reasons for which extend beyond best practices regarding security. Instead you should adjust the permissions of the private channel to allow "Who's There?" access.

## Spam Warning

Much like the soundboard and entrance sound Discord features, the potential for misuse and resulting voice spam is very high. In an attempt to prevent misuse, "Who's There?" employs strict (arguably harsh) checks for misuse with a globally increasing penalty exponent.

Additionally, it is also recommended that you remove the "connect" and/or "speak" permissions for "Who's There?" in voice channels that you do not want or need voice event announcements. Movie channels, game lobby or raid channels, and private or sensitive channels are all examples of places where voice events may interrupt the mood or flow of a conversation. Please use your best judgement.

"Who's There?" is more suitable for casual and lounge types channels.<br/>
<sup><i>It's actually more suitable for "mature" groups... but let's not go there... :P</i></sup>
